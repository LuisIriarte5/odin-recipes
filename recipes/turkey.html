            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
                <li>Line a roaster with sheets of aluminium foil long enough to wrap around turkey</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix together the parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, lemon-pepper seasoning, and salt.</li>
                <li>Rub the seasoning mixture inside the turkey cavity.</li>
                <li>Stuff the turkey with the orange wedges, onion, carrot, and celery.</li>
                <li>Tie the turkey legs with kitchen string, then tuck the wings under the body.</li>
                <li>Place the turkey on the foil in the roasting pan.</li>
                <li>Pour champagne and chicken broth over the turkey, ensuring some liquid gets into the cavity.</li>
                <li>Bring the aluminium foil up and over the top of turkey, sealing it.</li>
                <li>Roast the turkey in the preheated oven until juices run clear for over 2 1/2 to 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Uncover the turkey and continue baking until the skin turns golden brown for an additional 30 to 60 more minutes. If you have a thermometer, insert it into the thickest part of thigh and it should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C)</li>
                <li>Remove the turkey from the oven, cover it with two sheets of aluminium foil, and allow it to rest in a warm area for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
