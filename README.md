# odin-recipes

This is the first project on The Odin Project curriculum.
I will apply what ive learn in the following parts:
- Introduction
- Prerequisites
- Git basics
- HTML foundations

The objective is to make a webpage using only the HTML elements that Ive learn, with special focus on the ones to make lists, to link other pages and to show images. I will practice the basic instructions of Git as well.
